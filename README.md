## About Me

버지니아 공대(Virginia Tech)에서 **응용이산수학 전공, 컴퓨터과학 부전공**을 하고 있는 학부생입니다.  
자연어처리(NLP)와 대규모 언어모델(LLM), 서브모듈러 최적화, 추천 시스템에 관심이 있으며,  
AI 모델의 **효율성, 해석 가능성, 인간 중심 인터랙션**을 중심으로 연구하고자 합니다.

I'm a junior majoring in Applied Discrete Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science at Virginia Tech.  
I'm particularly interested in **natural language processing (NLP)**, **LLMs**, and **submodular optimization**,  
with a focus on **efficient learning, interpretability**, and **human-AI interaction**.
